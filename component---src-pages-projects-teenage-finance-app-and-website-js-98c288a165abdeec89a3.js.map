The research revealed that Jacob was\r\n            frustrated by the technical jargon on finance management available\r\n            online . We also learnt that Jakob needs a progress chart to know\r\n            his status and keep him motivated to achieve his targets.

The aim of this task was to have a uniform design so\r\n            that users feel familiar across devices and provide a smooth\r\n            uninterrupted experience.

Several ways to mark up the design to make it accessible for\r\n            users which was thought of were;\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>Navigation order annotations</li>\r\n              <li>Hierarchical headings</li>\r\n              <li>Accessibility labels for screen readers</li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img\r\n            className=\"image main\"\r\n            src={petadoption_responsive_mockup}\r\n            alt=\"\"\r\n          />\r\n          <h3 className=\"major\">Reflection</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            This project introduced me to Adobe XD.
