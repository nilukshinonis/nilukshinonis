They Provide\r\n            quality products at a reasonable cost to the local stationary\r\n            market. The brief was simple. They needed us to design a water\r\n            bottle for school children that was reusable and able to be\r\n            manufactured locally.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            We embarked on our design journey with the question{' '}\r\n            <strong>\r\n              “ How might we design a better water bottle for kids in Sri\r\n              Lanka?”.\r\n            </strong>{' '}\r\n            Our research and observations of the user gave us the right insights\r\n            to not just design one bottle but a range of bottles with an\r\n            identity to each design.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Apart From the usual consumption of water, kids used their bottle as\r\n            a toy to play with peers. So we gave each bottle a character and\r\n            made it more playful. This resulted in “Splash”, “Eco Fit”, “Hydro”,\r\n            “Refresh”, “Super-Fit” concepts. The ultimate product designs not\r\n            only encouraged kids to drink more water but also added the playful\r\n            sportiness kids longed for at a reasonable cost.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3 className=\"major\">The Team</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Lee Bazalgette ( Director, Colombo Design Studio(CDS)),Ruwini Perera\r\n            ( Operations Manager, CDS),Menusha Bennett ( Industrial Designer\r\n            CDS), Nipuni Siyabalpitiya ( Industrial Designer, CDS), Dinuka\r\n            Amarakoon( Intern, CDS), Senthilnathan Sobisan (Engineer, Atlas),\r\n            Sumudu Peiris( Brand Manager, Atlas) Ramani Samarasundera (\r\n            Marketing Director, Atlas)\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3 className=\"major\">My Role</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            As one of the key industrial designers my input came in the form of\r\n            sketches, extra ideas to add emotional value to the product,and\r\n            directly keeping up communications with the engineering and\r\n            marketing departments at Atlas presenting our thinking and\r\n            rationals. My highest contribution came at conceptualising,\r\n            designing, detailing, Prototyping and making production drawings\r\n            with simulation testing together with the engineers.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={atlas_waterbottlesketch} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <h3 className=\"major\">The Approach</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The journey in design was always revolving around the end user. Our\r\n            walls were full of millions of sketches and ideas back in the\r\n            studio. Next it was modeling the sketches in blue foam and adding\r\n            the tactile quality to our design for our users to feel the design\r\n            and give their feedback. Atlas representatives took these prototypes\r\n            out of colombo and came back with a list that bugged the kids and\r\n            additions they prefer. Next it was modeling in 3D solidworks and\r\n            soon after that our favourite; 3d printing. Finally with the making\r\n            of the moulds alot of late nights with the engineering teams on\r\n            volume and blow moulding requirements helped us go into production.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={atlas_waterbottleprototype} alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </section>\r\n  </Layout>\r\n);\r\n\r\nexport default IndexPage;\r\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_govi_casestudy_img-1e9f7e524a70d527d7803d5898c8b59a.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_atlas_waterbottle_sketch-ba2cbd43f156b5b09becf9425976e044.png\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
