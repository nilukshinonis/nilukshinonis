Even though Sri Lanka experiences sun and\n            rain, the available weather protective products are limited. Locally\n            available products to get cover are umbrellas, rain jackets and\n            caps. Among these products umbrellas report 90% sales annually\n            (Rainco annual report, 2015).{' '}\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Rainco Pvt Ltd is a leading umbrella manufacturer in Sri Lanka. 75%\n            annual sales of the company come from ladies compactable umbrellas.\n            Only 15% sales come from the gents‘ non compactable umbrellas. The\n            company wanted to understand why males didn’t buy umbrellas and see\n            if a product can be designed according to their need.\n          </p>\n\n          <h3 className=\"major\">The Problem</h3>\n          <h4>Why don’t males respond to weather protection devices?</h4>\n\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={viyana_research} alt=\"\" />\n          <h3 className=\"major\">The Approach</h3>\n          <p>\n            To understand the pulse of the user I conducted a survey. This\n            helped me realize the pain points related to the situation. A\n            questionnaire prepared on Google forms was sent out to 150 randomly\n            selected males who were active on social media platforms. With 123\n            responses I created an eco system map, user journey map and had\n            plenty of insights to work on.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            It was clear that umbrellas didn’t delight males. So my task was to\n            design a weather protection device that felt masculine. A solution\n            easy to use which provide quick cover and had immediate drying\n            properties.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            When analyzing the user a significant finding was that this group of\n            people had lots of energy. They are always in the look for\n            adventure. This is when the question arose; Can‘t the weather\n            protection designed give the adventure fact while protecting from\n            rain? Can there be a device to give the basic shade needed without\n            the complicated structures? Can I get inspiration from history to\n            solve this problem? Luckily for me in 1981 Sinhalese had used a\n            Talipot leaf folded as a fan for cover. So I decided to develop that\n            idea and ended up designing a product like a shield or an armor to\n            gain protection.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The armor had to be easy to open, use and fold. It had to be easy to\n            store and make the males feel comfortable when using it. Adding the\n            masculine qualities to the product could add the emotional value to\n            the product making it part of the male self-identity so that the\n            product wouldn‘t be forgotten. Another reason for weather gear to be\n            forgotten is once after use all weather gear requires an additional\n            effort to dry them and use back again. This process too had to be\n            looked into through the new concept.\n          </p>\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={viyana_sketch} alt=\"\" />\n          <p>\n            My ideas came to life as sketches on paper. Back in the field I\n            pitched the idea of a shield and guys showed interest. So I worked\n            on rapid prototyping. The hand of the user was what gave strength to\n            the product. It had no handle or complicated ribs. Initially users\n            wanted to fold the shield and fit into the pocket but with\n            limitations that was made to be flat packed.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Experiments helped me understand how the material combinations work\n            and react. The use of steel tension wire on the armor so an instant\n            pop-up could be achieved was my eureka moment to get quick cover.\n            Experimentation began with various thicknesses of steel wire, fabric\n            and joinery. Next I was on the look for water repellent material. A\n            material commonly known as ‘ponjee’ in the canopy industry had a\n            heavy water repellency coating. So that became the material for the\n            final product helping it dry in seconds.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            One of the main frustrations of weather gear is that once its wet\n            the product becomes difficult to handle. So a solution for this pain\n            point got me thinking of a cover. Many experiments with the cover\n            attached and detached were carried out.\n          </p>\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={viyana_joinspic} alt=\"\" />\n          <p>\n            A developed prototype made as an actual working model helped me get\n            users to test the product and give feedback and redesign. So I was\n            spending time with the manufacturers 108 km away from Colombo in the\n            Rainco factory in Kadugannawa. I built a few of them in different\n            colour variations and got my users to take it with them and give me\n            feedback.{' '}\n          </p>\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={viyana_charithpic} alt=\"\" />\n          <p>\n            The design has no handle and users asked for more grip. This\n            resulted in various textures and layers of padding . Heavy padding\n            meant more weight on the structure. Later feedback said they needed\n            it to be light, so I was peeling layer by layer until the user was\n            happy with the final outcome. The quick dry property was appreciated\n            in testing. Users opted to test more of my products which gave me\n            positive feedback to manufacture the final product model.\n          </p>\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={viyana_shenalpic} alt=\"\" />\n          <h3 className=\"major\">Reflection</h3>\n          <p>\n            No design has been able to fulfill the requirement in locals to gain\n            immediate cover which could eliminate the agonizing process of using\n            existing weather gear. I made an attempt to propose an innovative\n            product to gain immediate cover at a reasonable cost. An umbrella\n            manufacturing process takes roughly 25 minutes for one product to be\n            produced. My solution takes roughly 15 minutes to be manufactured in\n            that same facility. The beauty of this design is that it suites the\n            user perfectly with the instant cover and the masculine semiotics in\n            the product and simultaneously serves the clients objective of\n            catering to the local need utilizing the available resources of the\n            company. My project was highly commended by the board of examiners.\n            For 10 years the project is the intellectual property of the\n            University of Moratuwa. There is a possibility that Rainco will\n            produce this later on.\n          </p>\n          <div className=\"video-wrapper vimeo\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"Viyana Quick Shade intro\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"315\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HzoyYiMdcUs\"\n              frameborder=\"0\"\n              allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n              allowfullscreen\n            ></iframe>\n          </div>\n          <h3 className=\"major\">More Projects</h3>\n          <section className=\"features\">\n            <article>\n              <a\n                href=\"/projects/cover-me/\"\n                target=\"_blank\"\n                className=\"image\"\n              >\n                <img src={project_covemeapp} alt=\"\" />\n              </a>\n              <Link to=\"/projects/cover-me/\" className=\"special\">\n              Coverme App\n              </Link>\n            </article>\n            <article>\n              <a\n                href=\"/projects/mommy-halo/\"\n                target=\"_blank\"\n                className=\"image\"\n              >\n                <img src={project_halo_image} alt=\"\" />\n              </a>\n              <Link to=\"/projects/mommy-halo/\" className=\"special\">\n                Mommy Halo\n              </Link>\n            </article>\n          </section>\n        \n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default IndexPage;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_cover_me-b5784bf3c70738f9ebf61f2431fbd09f.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_halo-706864bbb391a5ceb873be5947759c0f.png\";"],"names":["Layout","fullMenu","id","className","src","viyana_research","alt","viyana_sketch","viyana_joinspic","viyana_charithpic","viyana_shenalpic","title","width","height","frameborder","allow","allowfullscreen","href","target","project_covemeapp","Link","to","project_halo_image"],"sourceRoot":""}
