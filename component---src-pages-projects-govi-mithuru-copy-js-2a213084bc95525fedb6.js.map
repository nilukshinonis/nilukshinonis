Most\n                farmers we visited had under developed roads.

They\n                chose to use their own discretion since they do not want to risk\n                losing a crop and income{' '}\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Farmers had access to a phone.

Surplus crops brought down incomes expected or\n                ended up going to waste due to being unable to sell.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Farmers want timely information that follows the crop calendar\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Farmers considered other farmers as competitors. They trust\n                middlemen and government bodies more than banks, MNOs’ and\n                financial institutes\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                Government information was only available to them during\n                weekdays.

So next we segmented\n            farmers into archetypes. This helped us decide who we are designing\n            for and who will be early adopters. Within each group, we looked for\n            patterns across farmers who have similar attitudes, aspirations,\n            community engagement, access to information, financial access, and\n            technical literacy.\n          </p>\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={magri_frog_table} alt=\"\" />\n          <p>\n            ‘Optimistic’ and ‘stuck’ farmers were target early adopters for this\n            service. Next we mapped the information collected in the field,\n            considering each touch point. Then we highlighted the pain points\n            and opportunities. We could see that every step of the journey a gap\n            existed in getting advice.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Framing all the insights we embarked on brainstorming ideas to solve\n            problems in general. The problem was reframed to “How might we\n            provide timely information to farmers?” Common patterns emerging\n            through the 80 farmers made it clear that the information gap neede.\n            The information had to come from the source they trust; the\n            Government. So we were collaborating with various government bodies\n            from then on.\n          </p>\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={magri_frog_wireframe} alt=\"\" />\n          <p>\n            Next the team went back to the insight board from the research and\n            iterated a key product feature for each insight. Out of a pool of\n            value propositions we identified that the product should bring the\n            right information to a farmer on request. It had to be giving\n            instructions in their native language.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Then we created a service blueprint. Later we decided on a feasible\n            product to launch quickly and planned for it. The minimum viable\n            product was for basic feature phones. Based on service blueprint we\n            listed the features. Quick pen and paper sketches iterated ways to\n            get the basic user interface in shape. We were back on the field\n            with card sorting to see if farmers appreciated the value added by\n            us to the product.\n          </p>\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={magri_frog_prototype} alt=\"\" />\n\n          <section className=\"features\">\n            <article>\n              <a href=\"/#\" className=\"image\">\n                <img src={pic4} alt=\"\" />\n              </a>\n            </article>\n            <article>\n              <a href=\"/#\" className=\"image\">\n                <img src={pic5} alt=\"\" />\n              </a>\n            </article>\n          </section>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default IndexPage;\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/pic05-ed59fcaa1ecb04bbca68214450449a46.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_govi_frog_postitwall-7d9a3f3ac6a8eb32d09fa4c75a746e54.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_govi_1-e28c49addcf3cc6db9ca70ae0b7e4b46.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_govi_frog_lilianandme-2572543afcba7a3fdde855af8610a696.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/pic04-56ffd4f5bd9426bef7ccf55a03830374.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
