He is interested in learning\n            how to manage his expenses so that he can buy himself the bike he\n            has always been dreaming of. The research revealed that Jacob was\n            frustrated by the technical jargon on finance management available\n            online . We also learnt that Jakob needs a progress chart to know\n            his status and keep him motivated to achieve his targets.
