            The final project for the UX certification program by Google was to
            design for social good. The topic received was to ‘design a way to
            help tutor teenagers in financial literacy’.According to Fox
            business news a study in 2020 by ING found out that “83% of teens
            don’t know how to manage money”. ‘Learn Finance’ aims to educate the
            next billion users about practical financial management and improve
            teenagers’ appetite for learning through its interactive UX learning
            platform.

          <p>
            To design a tool that helps teenagers learn and practice their
            financial management skills. For instance this tool will consist of
            free courses and bit sized crucial information on how to practically
            better manage your finances and later a platform to document your
            basic finances.

          <h3 className="major">Target audience</h3>
          <p>
            Learn Finances' primary users include teenagers who are concerned
            with managing their finance in a more inclusive and fun way. These
            are individuals who currently have no or limited financial control
            practices to manage their finances and reside in urban , suburban
            and rural areas.

          <h3>Research study</h3>
          <p>
            We conducted user research and received feedback from users that we
            turned into user personas. Jacob is a 14 year old highschool student
            who depends on his parents for money. He is interested in learning
            how to manage his expenses so that he can buy himself the bike he
            has always been dreaming of. The research revealed that Jacob was
            frustrated by the technical jargon on finance management available
            online . We also learnt that Jakob needs a progress chart to know
            his status and keep him motivated to achieve his targets. Jacob
            would like to learn in a more engaging way and use the concepts he
            learns in his daily life.

          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>
            Currently there is no platform that offers finance lessons a
            teenager needs in a form they understand
          </p>

          />
          <h3 className="major">Ideate</h3>
          <p>
            We identified some concepts for our app’s design based on what we
            learnt about our users in the empathize stage using the How might we
            approach. We rapidly brainstormed multiple creative solutions based
            on what we learnt from our research to identify various ways we
            could be designing.

          <h3>Sketching</h3>
          <p>
            Teenagers can be considered a category that falls under the Next
            Billion Users ( NBU) so we designed from the bottom up designing
            approach and started with designing the mobile version of the
            product and later adopted it to larger screen sizes. We sketched out
            some concepts for our app’s design based on what we learnt about our
            users in the empathize stage using the crazy eights approach.
          </p>

          />
          <h3>wireframes</h3>
          <p>
            In this stage we created the first levels of design using what we
            knew about our users and their needs. The headings are clearly
            listed and separated by categories, the lessons are chunked and
            progress of an individual is clearly displayed in a clear and simple
            manner.

          <h3>Lo-fi Prototypes</h3>
          <p>
            The low fidelity prototype connected the primary user flow of
            learning so the prototype could be used in a usability study with
            the users.

          <h3 className="major">Testing</h3>
          <h3>Research and usability Study</h3>
          <p>
            Our goal was to figure out what specific difficulties users
            encounter when they try to complete the core tasks of the financial
            literacy app: updating income, expenses and learning the basics of
            financial control and practically using it in their lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            We conducted an unmoderated usability study remotely between june
            09-16. 5 participants used the app to learn and plan their finances.
            Each session lasted for 30-60 minutes including the test and
            interview questions. Participants were teenagers(Two males, two
            females, and one nonbinary individual, aged 13 to 19 years old) 2
            part time workers 2 dependent on parents and one user with
            disability. They were all living in urban, suburban, and rural
            areas. Assistive technologies (keyboard, screen reader were
            provided)
          </p>
          <p>
            We presented participants with a series of tasks to understand how
            much time users spend on learning and completing a lesson. Later we
            had them complete a System Usability Scale to evaluate feedback and
            noted on a note taking spreadsheet
          </p>
          <img

            src={teenagefinaceapp_after_changes_wireframes_gif}
            alt=""
          />
          <h3>User testing results</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Based on the theme that: (Users don't have ability to see what
                course they are taking), an insight is: (add name of course to
                home screen ).
              </li>
              <li>
                Based on the theme that: (Users can’t take multiple courses at
                the same time ), an insight is: (drop down in an area that has
                the title of the course that's been taken so that users can
                select).
              </li>
              <li>
                Based on the theme that: (users want more engaging activity in
                the app), an insight is: (make the app feel like a game and take
                kids from level1 to the next ).
              </li>
              <li>
                Based on the theme that: (Taking notes is annoying for users),
                an insight is: (include area with video transcript).
              </li>
              <li>
                Based on the theme that: (users with vision impairment cannot
                insert answers), an insight is: (include an option to answer
                using microphone).
              </li>
              <li>
                Based on the theme that: (users couldn't close lessons when they
                wanted to), an insight is: (include close option in every
                screen).
              </li>
              <li>
                Based on the theme that: (users who access apps with voice
                assistants have to go through the entire transcript before
                coming to the continue option), an insight is: (include the
                continue button soon after the video in lesson).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>Changes</h3>
          <p>
            Early designs allowed for only viewing progress of goal , but after
            the usability studies, we added the learning progress graph to the
            home screen. An ability to quickly get to the lesson and if needed
            to find other suitable lessons was the next addition to the app
            after the usability findings. We also revised the design bringing
            the buttons higher so a user with a voice assistant could navigate
            better on the app.
          </p>

          <h3>Mockups and high-fidelity prototype</h3>

          <p>
            At this point in the design cycle, we began to add colours, images,
            and icons to our design. We updated the shape, size and structure of
            content to suit teenagers and improve the user experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            We then moved from designing and prototyping to create a high
            fidelity prototype with animations encouraging teenagers to learn
            and use the service. It was again sent for user testing and improved
            which helped us complete the final prototype which we presented to
            the stakeholders and then passed off to the Development Team for
            production.

          <h3>Designing a responsive web</h3>
          <p>
            The purpose of the dedicated mobile app was to get tenagers flexibly
            learn and manage their finances on the go.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of the corresponding website was to make the platform
            for teachers to volunteer and students to easily find content they
            need. This is a design for social good so that the next generation
            of adults will be groomed to manage their finances better through a
            free online service.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            Since it is a free service offered this responsive web was the tool
            that will help Learn Finance attract companies and individuals who
            share their same values to join the cause.
          </p>
          <h3>Sketching</h3>
          <p>
            We again sketched out some concepts for our website’s design based
            on what we learnt about our users in the empathize stage using the
            crazy eights approach. Then the basic user flow for the web
            application was sketched.

          <p>
            Then sketched how the screens will adjust in different screen sizes
            on square paper.

          <h3>Wireframe and lo-fi prototype- website on mobile</h3>
          <p>
            The next step of the process was to design the mobile screen of the
            app.

          <h3>Wireframe and lo-fi prototype- website on tab</h3>
          <p>
            Then the website on a tablet screen and its main user journey was
            digitally wireframes and prototyped.

          <h3>Wireframe and lo-fi prototype- web</h3>

            Then the layouts of the website on the biggest screen size were
            designed and prototyped.

          <h3>Mock up and Hi-fi Prototype of responsive site</h3>
          <p>
            At this point in the design cycle, we began to add colours, images,
            and icons to our design. We updated the shape, size and structure of
            content to suit teenagers and improve the user experience and tried
            to keep up with consistency between the design language of the app
            and website.

          />
          <h3>Accessibility considerations</h3>
          <p>
            To ensure the app was accessible we included users of assistive
            technologies such as keyboards and screen readers throughout all
            stages of the design cycle including in interviews and usability
            testing. We took their needs and feedback and incorporated what we
            learned into our designs in order to provide an inclusive and
            accessible experience for all. The website was designed keeping in
            mind the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).Accessible
            color and contrast was used.

          <p>
            This project introduced me to Adobe XD. It is very similar to Figma
            yet there are many advantages to designing user experiences in this
            platform. I also understood extremely well on how responsive sites
            and each screen was individually designed and the importance of
            designing to web accessibility standards.
