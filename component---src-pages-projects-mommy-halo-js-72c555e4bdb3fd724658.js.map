Ever Since the discovery of electricity humans\r\n            have developed more and more devices that produce EMF( televisions,\r\n            microwaves, and radios to name a few. Recently cell phones and\r\n            tablets ).

We started with a\r\n            little bit of role playing in the studio and later gathered insights\r\n            from concerned mothers. Our design splints of creating quick and\r\n            rudimentary ideas ultimately ended up in the final design of the\r\n            donut shaped ergonomic design that adjusts with growing bellies.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The final design is a wireless,portable, incredibly comfortable\r\n            protector , you can take anywhere.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3 className=\"major\">Reflection</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Mommy Halo is created with a global product certification EMC-EMF\r\n            safety approval.Its innovative and practical while keeping the user\r\n            connected to watch work or relax feeling protected.It began with 2\r\n            concerned parents questioning how to protect their unborn from\r\n            radiation and ended up as a kickstarter project that became a\r\n            success.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The project was an exercise of working closely with many\r\n            disciplines.
