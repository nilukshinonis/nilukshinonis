Since they want to get to their destination\r\n            without interruption from rain they choose CoverMe. The app enables\r\n            them to rent an umbrella and never worry about bad weather again.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <h3 className=\"major\">The Problem</h3>\r\n          <p>How might we get an umbrella when we need it?</p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            An umbrella is a might need product that’s needed in rain and\r\n            forgotten about otherwise. I have worked with a leading umbrella\r\n            manufacturer in Sri Lanka and pitched this app. I hope it will\r\n            benefit many who feel helpless at bad weather situations. A young\r\n            male is the primary target group for this app anyone who forgets\r\n            their umbrella will also benefit from this app.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3>The Approach</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            I started off storyboarding my problem. Later discussions with my\r\n            user groups gave me plenty of insights to work on. Grouping the user\r\n            personas makes life easy. Then I embarked on creating the journey\r\n            map to see how the app will function. More refinements got me to\r\n            sketching and wireframing which ended up in a high fidelity\r\n            prototype done on figma.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            During the initial concept stages I did a survey to develop a better\r\n            understanding of the user group. The documented data helped in\r\n            creating user groups.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={coverme_usergroups} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <p>\r\n            ‘Light’ and ‘Heavy Rainers’ will be target early adopters for this\r\n            app. After some concepts were formed and the competitive landscape\r\n            was examined, rough user flows were created that were expanded upon\r\n            to build the first screens.{' '}\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={coverme_userflow} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <p>\r\n            Working through storyboards very quickly helps visualize solutions.\r\n            This helped understand the journey better and put my self in the\r\n            user’s shoes. It was also helpful when pitching the idea to the\r\n            client and figure out my core features and secondary features in the\r\n            app when designing.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={coverme_storyboard} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <p>\r\n            <strong>Onboarding</strong>\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The onboarding begins with the option to sign up or skip sign up and\r\n            experience the app. Experiencing the app will increase the\r\n            probability of purchasing the product. Once the user is in the map\r\n            showing closest coverme station eventually scanning the QR code will\r\n            redirect the user to register. Registration is a simple four step\r\n            process after experience from user feedback. Next comes up a quick\r\n            start pictorial guide easy to understand. Then comes a cashless\r\n            payment method selection based on most common practices in Sri\r\n            Lanka.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={coverme_onboarding} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <p>\r\n            <strong>Pop-up Alerts</strong>\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            This interaction channels simplicity and requires the user to act or\r\n            ignore. A click on it will open the app map and show the closest\r\n            coverme station. Returning will also come with pop up notifications\r\n            reminding the user at intervals.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={coverme_popupalerts} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <p>\r\n            <strong>Userflow</strong>\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The structure of the app is based on rent and return fast. With a\r\n            touch of a button the QR code will scan the QR code in vending\r\n            machine and release a locked umbrella. It will be able to be used\r\n            for a time frame of 4 Hours. When the time is running up more\r\n            notifications will remind the user to return umbrella. A typical\r\n            user behavior of returning the umbrella within the allocated time\r\n            frame will reward the user with points.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Usually a wet umbrella is left to dry after use. This makes it easy\r\n            to forget. Coverme will send reminders when the user is 20m away\r\n            from the umbrella eliminating loss of product.{' '}\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            <strong>Style Guide</strong>\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            This is the first digital product under the Rainco Brand. To avoid\r\n            common misconceptions with brand coverme will act independently as a\r\n            fresh intervention. Keeping the rainco style guide in mind I created\r\n            a UX kit to work on. This helped maintain consistency in the design\r\n            process.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={coverme_graphicelements} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <h3 className=\"major\">Reflection</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Overall, this product development cycle was a success. More\r\n            interactions with Engineering and Product development teams will\r\n            bring this to every train station, bus stop in and around Colombo at\r\n            the kick off stage. To enjoy the benefit of the design Rainco will\r\n            have to make sure it markets to the target segment appropriately.\r\n            Since it was a proof of concent project many changes are expected to\r\n            take place.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </section>\r\n  </Layout>\r\n);\r\n\r\nexport default IndexPage;\r\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_coverme_graphicelements-c1e6ebb95c28d539b8d13d16c7b90a20.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_coverme_storyboard-4e1d5677019d5bf4629ea28bf6f58a7c.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_coverme_userflow-adc5809638cb3f83d89b775160d09f49.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_coverme_popupalerts-2c79dbaab563073e726a1586c60e681c.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_coverme_usergroups-0547f902a0347187ef0deadeaa3dd102.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_coverme_onboarding-6778f44a733d446f2596a3c182292edf.gif\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
