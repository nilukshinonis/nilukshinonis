Here majority of farmer clusters\r\n            can be observed. With known contacts we had a few farmers to\r\n            interview.

Most\r\n                farmers we visited had under developed roads. It was a struggle\r\n                to get to experts for necessary advice\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                Farmers were aware of the services offered to them by MNOs but\r\n                chose not to use them.

They\r\n                chose to use their own discretion since they do not want to risk\r\n                losing a crop and income{' '}\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                Farmers had access to a phone.

Crop security was very low due to\r\n                unpredictable weather conditions.\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                Since farming is seasonal most farmers grow the same variations\r\n                of Vegetables. Surplus crops brought down incomes expected or\r\n                ended up going to waste due to being unable to sell.\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                Farmers want timely information that follows the crop calendar\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                Farmers considered other farmers as competitors. They trust\r\n                middlemen and government bodies more than banks, MNOs’ and\r\n                financial institutes\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                Government information was only available to them during\r\n                weekdays. Which meant leaving all the work behind to go speak to\r\n                an expert for advice (So they rarely went for advice)\r\n              </li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            It was clear that all farmers are not the same. So next we segmented\r\n            farmers into archetypes. This helped us decide who we are designing\r\n            for and who will be early adopters. Within each group, we looked for\r\n            patterns across farmers who have similar attitudes, aspirations,\r\n            community engagement, access to information, financial access, and\r\n            technical literacy.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={magri_frog_table} alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\n          <section className=\"features\">\r\n            <article>\r\n              <a href=\"/#\" className=\"image\">\r\n                <img src={pic4} alt=\"\" />\r\n              </a>\r\n            </article>\r\n            <article>\r\n              <a href=\"/#\" className=\"image\">\r\n                <img src={pic5} alt=\"\" />\r\n              </a>\r\n            </article>\r\n          </section>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </section>\r\n  </Layout>\r\n);\r\n\r\nexport default IndexPage;\r\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/pic05-ed59fcaa1ecb04bbca68214450449a46.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_govi_frog_postitwall-7d9a3f3ac6a8eb32d09fa4c75a746e54.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_govi_1-e28c49addcf3cc6db9ca70ae0b7e4b46.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_govi_frog_lilianandme-2572543afcba7a3fdde855af8610a696.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/pic04-56ffd4f5bd9426bef7ccf55a03830374.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
