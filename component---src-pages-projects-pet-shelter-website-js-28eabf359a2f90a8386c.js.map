To better understand the problem I\r\n            spoke to multiple individuals and worked on empathy maps. With the\r\n            insights collected I created a user persona to work on.{' '}\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={snacker_user_persona_image} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <h3 className=\"major\">Define</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            User story and user journey of Akil helped define the problem\r\n            better.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h4>Problem statement</h4>\r\n          <p>\r\n            “Akil is a dependent teenager who needs to save money but at the\r\n            same time enjoy movies and snacks with his friends because everytime\r\n            he goes to a movie he buys snacks for his friends and never gets\r\n            refunded.”\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h4>User story</h4>\r\n          <p>\r\n            “As a University student I want to meet friends and share costs of\r\n            snacks we buy at a movie so that it's fair and I will save money.”\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3>User research pain points</h3>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={snacker_pain_point_image} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <h3>User flow</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Next I conducted a competitive audit on apps that offer similar\r\n            services and started brainstorming ideas on how to help Akil have a\r\n            better user experience the next time he goes to a movie.

Taking time to draft iterations of\r\n            each screen of the app on paper ensured that elements that made it\r\n            to digital wireframes would be well-suited to address user pain\r\n            points. For the Home screen I prioritized a quick and easy ordering\r\n            process with a chatbot to help users save time and order their\r\n            snacks. Stars were used to mark the elements of each sketch that\r\n            would be used in the wireframes.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={snacker_paper_wireframes} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <h3>Digital Wireframes and Lo-fi Prototypes</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The next task was to do digital wireframes. This helped visualize\r\n            how the design will look as I create the user interface and show\r\n            areas to improve. I made sure to base screen designs on feedback and\r\n            findings from the initial user research. Quick and easy access were\r\n            key user needs to address in the design followed by the app\r\n            supporting assistive technologies.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={snacker_digital_wireframes} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <h3 className=\"major\">Testing</h3>\r\n          <h3>User testing results</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The low fidelity prototype connected the primary user flow of\r\n            selecting and ordering snacks so the prototype could be used in a\r\n            usability study with the users in the next step.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>View the prototype on link</p>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={snacker_lo_fi_prototype} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <p>\r\n            I conducted two rounds of usability studies.

Initial\r\n            unmoderated study online requested users to complete a few tasks on\r\n            the lo-fi prototype and talk through their thoughts in a recording.\r\n            These recordings were all analysed and I created a note taking\r\n            spreadsheet which helped build affinity diagrams.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={snacker_affinity_diagram} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <h3>Usability study findings</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>The buttons seem too small to click for most participants</li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                The bag at the bottom and checkout cart need to be the same\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>Split button needs to be placed in a more visual area</li>\r\n              <li>Simplify split features to make it easy to use</li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={snacker_usertest_changes} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <h3>Design Systems</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Building a sticker sheet of the Ui elements I need in Figma was\r\n            helpful in creating the mock ups for the app. I used red as a\r\n            primary colour since it is stimulating and energizing creating the\r\n            urge to buy snacks.{' '}\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={snacker_ui_elements} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <h3>Mockups and high-fidelity prototype</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The final high-fidelity prototype presented cleaner user flows for\r\n            ordering snacks and easy checkout.

I took their needs and feedback and incorporated what I\r\n            learned into the designs in order to provide an inclusive and\r\n            accessible experience for all.\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>\r\n                I tried to provide access to users who are vision impaired\r\n                through adding alt text to images for screen readers.\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                I used detailed imagery of snacks to help all users better\r\n                understand the designs.\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                Accessibility placeholder text in every button and icon was also\r\n                used to increase accessibility in the app\r\n              </li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3 className=\"major\">Reflection</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            One of the biggest learnings of this project was that wireframes\r\n            have to be completely basic. Since I made my wireframes detailed\r\n            with buttons and text sizes the feedback I received was more into\r\n            the UI development. I wish I had a better prototype to test the\r\n            features and improve the user experience.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <section className=\"features\">\r\n            <article>\r\n              <a\r\n                href=\"https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/govi-mithuru-mobile-agriculture-service-dialog-sri-lanka.pdf\"\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n                className=\"image\"\r\n              >\r\n                <img src={magri_frog_casestudyimage} alt=\"\" />\r\n              </a>\r\n              <a\r\n                href=\"https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/govi-mithuru-mobile-agriculture-service-dialog-sri-lanka.pdf\"\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n                className=\"special\"\r\n              >\r\n                See the case study\r\n              </a>\r\n            </article>\r\n            <article>\r\n              <a\r\n                href=\"https://www.dialog.lk/govi-mithuru/\"\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n                className=\"image\"\r\n              >\r\n                <img src={magri_frog_articleimage} alt=\"\" />\r\n              </a>\r\n              <a\r\n                href=\"https://www.dialog.lk/govi-mithuru/\"\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n                className=\"special\"\r\n              >\r\n                Read article\r\n              </a>\r\n            </article>\r\n          </section>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </section>\r\n  </Layout>\r\n);\r\n\r\nexport default IndexPage;\r\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_snacker_affinity_diagram-1f0c2a0657316012cd9d3bdba6f00d1b.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_snacker_ui_elements-f445b7755d41f233caa10bc77e302619.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_snacker_changes_after_user_testing-0dcbcc59171d809cffb2b1562030e979.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_snacker_digital_wireframes-52372ab780094458856b98647e1c66f2.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_govi_casestudy_img-1e9f7e524a70d527d7803d5898c8b59a.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_snacker_paper_wireframes-12be72bfd2751d2151188eaf05cc2961.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_snacker_user_flow-cdbf3926aa43646be762772cc23bedf4.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_snacker_user_persona-7d3c9729b29eaa2805419aeacd0b548f.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_petadoption_design_process-a63016c9f9a9a7a9cb52351b642bd173.png\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
