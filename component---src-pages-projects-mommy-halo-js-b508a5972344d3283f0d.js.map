We have been\r\n            exposed to EMF from many different sources, such as earth's magnetic\r\n            field and the sun. Ever Since the discovery of electricity humans\r\n            have developed more and more devices that produce EMF( televisions,\r\n            microwaves, and radios to name a few. Recently cell phones and\r\n            tablets ). These small devices bring EMF closer and in more\r\n            concentrated doses to everyone.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Mommy Halo was created to shield EMF radiation from potentially\r\n            chronic occupational exposure caused by the use of phones and\r\n            tablets.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <h3 className=\"major\">The Team</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Lee Bazalgette ( Director, Colombo Design Studio(CDS)),Ruwini Perera\r\n            ( Operations Manager, CDS) Menusha Bennett ( Industrial Designer\r\n            CDS), Shafeek Akil ( Student Engineer, CDS), Anthony Ayers( Owner,\r\n            Baby Assured), Robin Ayers ( Co-Owner, Baby Assured), Buddhi\r\n            Paranamana(Project Manager, Hela Innovation)Malveena Jayawardena\r\n            (Executive, Hela Innovation), Michelle Balapitya ( Executive, Hela\r\n            Innovation)\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3 className=\"major\">My Role</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            As an Industrial designer I contributed in research , role play,\r\n            ideation,concept generation,presentations in pitching to client and\r\n            stakeholders, rapid prototyping, sketching and refining concepts,\r\n            solidworks modelling and detailing, rendering, making of the\r\n            production drawings and monitoring the production process.

We started with a little bit of role playing\r\n            in the studio and later gathered insights from concerned mothers.\r\n            Our design splints of creating quick and rudimentary ideas\r\n            ultimately ended up in the final design of the donut shaped\r\n            ergonomic design that adjusts with growing bellies.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The final design is a wireless,portable, incredibly comfortable\r\n            protector , you can take anywhere.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3 className=\"major\">Reflection</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Mommy Halo is created with a global product certification EMC-EMF\r\n            safety approval.Its innovative and practical while keeping the user\r\n            connected to watch work or relax feeling protected.It began with 2\r\n            concerned parents questioning how to protect their unborn from\r\n            radiation and ended up as a kickstarter project that became a\r\n            success.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The project was an exercise of working closely with many\r\n            disciplines.
