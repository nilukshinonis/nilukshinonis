Since they want to get to their destination\r\n            without interruption from rain they choose CoverMe. The app enables\r\n            them to rent an umbrella and never worry about bad weather again.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <h3 className=\"major\">The Problem</h3>\r\n          <p>How might we get an umbrella when we need it?</p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            An umbrella is a might need product thatâ€™s needed in rain and\r\n            forgotten about otherwise. I have worked with a leading umbrella\r\n            manufacturer in Sri Lanka and pitched this app. I hope it will\r\n            benefit many who feel helpless at bad weather situations. A young\r\n            male is the primary target group for this app anyone who forgets\r\n            their umbrella will also benefit from this app.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3>The Approach</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            I started off storyboarding my problem. Later discussions with my\r\n            user groups gave me plenty of insights to work on. Grouping the user\r\n            personas makes life easy. Then I embarked on creating the journey\r\n            map to see how the app will function. More refinements got me to\r\n            sketching and wireframing which ended up in a high fidelity\r\n            prototype done on figma.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            During the initial concept stages I did a survey to develop a better\r\n            understanding of the user group. The documented data helped in\r\n            creating user groups.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={viyana_research} alt=\"\" />\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </section>\r\n  </Layout>\r\n);\r\n\r\nexport default IndexPage;\r\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_govi_casestudy_img-1e9f7e524a70d527d7803d5898c8b59a.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_viyana_research-581c62e3f340437b9266ce559195abee.png\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
