Yet adopting a pet from a shelter\n            or ‘Tierheim’ is unnecessarily stressful. Initial discussions with\n            pet lovers who wish to adopt pets revealed that they have to visit\n            the shelter multiple times and complete a lot of paperwork before\n            adoption. This rose to question if the adoption process can be made\n            easy and contactless online through a web site. Empathy maps helped\n            better frame the user's problem.\n          </p>\n          <img\n            className=\"image main\"\n            src={petadoption_emapthy_map_gif}\n            alt=\"\"\n          />\n          <p>\n            User personas helped understand various use cases the website will\n            have to consider.\n          </p>\n\n          <img\n            className=\"image main\"\n            src={petadoption_user_personas_gif}\n            alt=\"\"\n          />\n          <h3 className=\"major\">Define</h3>\n          <p>\n            Problem statements and user stories each persona helped define the\n            problem better.\n          </p>\n          <img\n            className=\"image main\"\n            src={petadoption_userstory_problemstatement}\n            alt=\"\"\n          />\n          <h3>User research pain points</h3>\n          <img\n            className=\"image main\"\n            src={petadoption_user_painpoints}\n            alt=\"\"\n          />\n          <h3>Site map</h3>\n          <p>\n            A hierarchical model in information architecture helped organize the\n            content in the website and allow users to understand where they are\n            and where the information they want is in the website.\n          </p>\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={petadoption_site_map} alt=\"\" />\n\n          <h3 className=\"major\">Ideate</h3>\n\n          <h3>Sketches and wireframes</h3>\n          <p>\n            Quick hand drawn paper wireframes helped the creative juices flow in\n            the process and build many possible ways of designing.\n          </p>\n\n          <img\n            className=\"image main\"\n            src={petadoption_paper_wireframes}\n            alt=\"\"\n          />\n          <h3>Digital Wireframes and Lo-fi Prototypes</h3>\n          <p>\n            The next task was to do digital wireframes.

Several ways to mark up the design to make it accessible for\n            users which was thought of were;\n            <ul>\n              <li>Navigation order annotations</li>\n              <li>Hierarchical headings</li>\n              <li>Accessibility labels for screen readers</li>\n            </ul>\n          </p>\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={petadoption_responsive_mockup} alt=\"\" />\n          <h3 className=\"major\">Reflection</h3>\n          <p>\n            This project introduced me to Adobe XD. It is very similar to Figma\n            yet there are many advantages to designing user experiences in this\n            platform. I also understood extremely well on how responsive sites\n            and each screen was individually designed and the importance of\n            designing to web accessibility standards.\n          </p>\n          <div className=\"video-wrapper\">\n            <iframe\n              title=\"Petadoption website flow video\"\n              width=\"560\"\n              height=\"315\"\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zp9K9qr7jPk\"\n              frameborder=\"0\"\n              allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n              allowfullscreen\n            ></iframe>\n          </div>\n          <section className=\"features\">\n          <h3 className=\"major\">More Projects</h3>\n            <article>\n              <a\n                href=\"/projects/pet-shelter-website/\"\n                target=\"_blank\"\n                className=\"image\"\n              >\n                <img src={project_petshelter_web_image} alt=\"\" />\n              </a>\n              <Link to=\"/projects/snacker-app\" className=\"special\">\n              Pet Shelter Website\n              </Link>\n            </article>\n            <article>\n              <a\n                href=\"/projects/teenage-finance-app-and-website/\"\n                target=\"_blank\"\n                className=\"image\"\n              >\n                <img src={project_financeapp} alt=\"\" />\n              </a>\n              <Link to=\"/projects/snacker-app\" className=\"special\">\n                Finance App for Teens\n              </Link>\n            </article>\n          </section>\n        \n          </div>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default IndexPage;\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/petshelter_web_emapthy_maps-7bdb822943bdbfe51c1b4463e799c83c.gif\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_petshelter-6b43049e27c08149579a5987134b969e.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_petadoption_lofi_prototype-7228247d287dac37d74e8177ca8c719f.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_petadoption_affinity_diagram-dc25d0a80836f2da53dc8882ad951961.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_petadoption_paper_wireframes-63f8241a8823989ae97ffd674b575e0b.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_petadoption_digital_wireframes-23b8cee98d63ac270d80a8ff31071bc4.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_petadoption_all_digital_responsive_screens-47e9edebe4c2bb6ec365fe49713353ca.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_financeapp-a5081a4f38a2a1d19eb186e4480ba0ea.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_petadoption_responsive_mockup-40ca63612771f939de68a0667511e155.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_petadoption_design_process-a63016c9f9a9a7a9cb52351b642bd173.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_petadoption_site_map-44bd850f8ee23e31b1719d6b7018a046.png\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
