The campaign is a system design\r\n            to create awareness and spark a recycling culture to get more people\r\n            to Reduce, Reuse or Recycle their plastic waste. The focal point of the\r\n            project is a carefully designed bin placed all over the island in\r\n            the hope of collecting and recycling plastics. The bin is not only\r\n            an icon but also an internal tool for the company to help create new\r\n            consumer behaviour and rethink how we dispose of plastic.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <h3 className=\"major\">The Problem</h3>\r\n          <h4>\r\n            “How might we encourage Sri Lankans to dispose of their plastics\r\n            responsibly?”.\r\n          </h4>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Much of SriLanka’s coastline and landmass has been tarnished by the\r\n            irresponsible disposal of plastic waste.{' '}\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            In 2017 a garbage dump outside Sri Lanka’s capital Colombo collapsed\r\n            and killed 30.This was an eye opener to many leading plastic\r\n            manufacturers to create a system that collects the plastic they give\r\n            to the consumer in order to recycle. Hence the Plastic-cycle project\r\n            was initiated in 2018 June and we at Colombo Design studio were\r\n            designing the Bin and its branding and identity. It’s a personal\r\n            favorite out of all the projects I have done to source material and\r\n            fabricate the bins at Supermarkets and highway entry/exit points.\r\n            The project reached a milestone of collecting 50 metric tons of\r\n            plastic by January 2019 and continues.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3 className=\"major\">The Team</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Lee Bazalgette ( Director, Colombo Design Studio(CDS)),Ruwini Perera\r\n            ( Operations Manager, CDS),Leah Marikkar (Director, Dentsu Aegis\r\n            Network)Menusha Bennett ( Industrial Designer CDS), Clemens Thieler\r\n            ( Intern, CDS), Buddhika Muthukumarana (General Manager,Viridis\r\n            Plastic Recycling), Nisreen Rahmanjee( Head of Social\r\n            Entrepreneurship Project, John Keells Group),Monaka Perumal( Brand\r\n            manager, Dentsu Aegis Network), Jayananda Kalpana( Manufacturer,\r\n            KALPANA ADS (PVT) LTD)\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3 className=\"major\">My Role</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            As a product designer my input was mainly for the initial\r\n            brainstorming sessions of diverging and converging ideas for the\r\n            campaign that took a number of stages.
