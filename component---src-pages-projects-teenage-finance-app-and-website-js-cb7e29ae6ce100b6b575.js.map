He is interested in learning\r\n            how to manage his expenses so that he can buy himself the bike he\r\n            has always been dreaming of. The research revealed that Jacob was\r\n            frustrated by the technical jargon on finance management available\r\n            online . We also learnt that Jakob needs a progress chart to know\r\n            his status and keep him motivated to achieve his targets.

An ability to quickly get to the lesson and if needed\r\n            to find other suitable lessons was the next addition to the app\r\n            after the usability findings. We also revised the design bringing\r\n            the buttons higher so a user with a voice assistant could navigate\r\n            better on the app.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={petadoption_lofi_prototype} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <h3>Mockups and high-fidelity prototype</h3>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            At this point in the design cycle, we began to add colours, images,\r\n            and icons to our design.

It was again sent for user testing and improved\r\n            which helped us complete the final prototype which we presented to\r\n            the stakeholders and then passed off to the Development Team for\r\n            production.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>View Prototype</p>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={petadoption_after_changes} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <p>View the prototype after the changes from user testing on link</p>\r\n          <h3>Mockups and high-fidelity prototype</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            A few A/B tests were conducted to understand if users will prefer\r\n            real life images or illustrations in the home screen and if they\r\n            prefer a slider view or collage view of seeing the images of a\r\n            selected pet.

So\r\n            the process to design how the website will appear on smaller screens\r\n            was initiated. The aim of this task was to have a uniform design so\r\n            that users feel familiar across devices and provide a smooth\r\n            uninterrupted experience.

Several ways to mark up the design to make it accessible for\r\n            users which was thought of were;\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>Navigation order annotations</li>\r\n              <li>Hierarchical headings</li>\r\n              <li>Accessibility labels for screen readers</li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img\r\n            className=\"image main\"\r\n            src={petadoption_responsive_mockup}\r\n            alt=\"\"\r\n          />\r\n          <h3 className=\"major\">Reflection</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            This project introduced me to Adobe XD.
