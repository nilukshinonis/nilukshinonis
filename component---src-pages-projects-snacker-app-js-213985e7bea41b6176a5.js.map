skip long lines and\r\n            pick up their snacks at their convenience.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3 className=\"major\">Design Process</h3>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\"

</p>\r\n          <h3 className=\"major\">Research study</h3>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            I conducted interviews remotely with several participants who enjoy\r\n            going to a movie theater and usually order snacks. After talking to\r\n            them about their experiences and expectations of a snack ordering\r\n            app I found some focus points to develop the app design.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>Order food and drinks from an extensive menu</li>\r\n            <li>See what is available and not</li>\r\n            <li>Choose between pick up or deliver to your seat</li>\r\n            <li>Real-time order tracking</li>\r\n            <li>Multiple payment options</li>\r\n            <li>Save frequently used cards and payment methods</li>\r\n            <li>Split bill among a group</li>\r\n            <li>Rate and feedback system</li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Then an unmoderated usability study on 5 participants; all movie\r\n            goers which consisted of 2 elders (30-65) 2 young dependents (18-29)\r\n            and one assistive technological user helped me test Initial\r\n            wireframes and hi-fi prototypes.{' '}\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <h3 className=\"major\">Initial design concepts</h3>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            Snack ordering is unnecessarily stressful. You have to get them\r\n            early before your favorites sell out and you always end up in a long\r\n            line missing parts of the movie. To better understand the problem I\r\n            spoke to multiple individuals and worked on empathy maps. With the\r\n            insights collected I created a user persona to work on.{' '}\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={snacker_user_persona_image} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <p>\r\n            Then I created the user story, user journey of and crafted the\r\n            problem statement.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h4>Problem statement</h4>\r\n          <p>\r\n            “Akil is a dependent teenager who needs to save money but at the\r\n            same time enjoy movies and snacks with his friends because everytime\r\n            he goes to a movie he buys snacks for his friends and never gets\r\n            refunded.”\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h4>User story</h4>\r\n          <p>\r\n            “As a University student I want to meet friends and share costs of\r\n            snacks we buy at a movie so that it's fair and I will save money.”\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3>User research pain points</h3>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={snacker_pain_point_image} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <h3>User flow</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Next I conducted a competitive audit on apps that offer similar\r\n            services and started brainstorming ideas on how to help akil have a\r\n            better user experience the next time he goes to a movie. Then the\r\n            next step was to create the user flow of the app.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3 className=\"major\">The Approach</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The selected locations were Nuwara Eliya 175km from Colombo and\r\n            Anuradhapura 201 km from Colombo. Here majority of farmer clusters\r\n            can be observed. With known contacts we had a few farmers to\r\n            interview. Later the team continued recruiting as we were in the\r\n            field making new connections.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={magri_frog_ecosystem} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <p>\r\n            The project team interviewed 80 farmers at their homes and work\r\n            fields to test hypothesis already built. Before getting on the field\r\n            we needed to identify all the actors who have an influence on the\r\n            farmer. So we mapped the eco system. In the planning stage we\r\n            thought;\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>Farmers didn’t have access to information</li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                So Farmers didn’t know most product offered for them by MNOs\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>So they used excessive pesticides on harvest</li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                Didn’t get good prices due to middle men who exploit them and\r\n                their financial situation\r\n              </li>\r\n\r\n              <li>\r\n                Farmers wholly trusted their family, friends and fellow farmers.\r\n                They trusted government bodies MNO’s , banks and microfinance\r\n                institutes more than middlemen (Since their hard-earned crops\r\n                were always devalued by middlemen).\r\n              </li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={magri_frog_lilian_and_me} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <p>\r\n            How we tested these Hypothesis’s were;\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>\r\n                In-depth interviews with farmers to extract the why to most\r\n                frustrations they have\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                Intercept interviews to understand the whole farming ecosystem\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                Farming life cycle exercise to understand a farmer's journey\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>Trust maps to understand trust and decision making</li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                House- farm tour to understand farmers stand on technology and\r\n                connectivity\r\n              </li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={magri_frog_postitwall} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <p>\r\n            Our findings were surprising;\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>\r\n                Farmers had access to information but it was deficient. Most\r\n                farmers we visited had under developed roads. It was a struggle\r\n                to get to experts for necessary advice\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                Farmers were aware of the services offered to them by MNOs but\r\n                chose not to use them. In simple terms they didn’t trust MNO’s\r\n                for advice.\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                Farmers were aware of the amounts of pesticides prescribed. They\r\n                chose to use their own discretion since they do not want to risk\r\n                losing a crop and income{' '}\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                Farmers had access to a phone. Self-owned or owned by a family\r\n                member\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                Farmers did not want their young to pursue Agriculture as it was\r\n                tedious work and a huge gamble\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                Life is a daily struggle pawing valuables or borrowing money\r\n                from micro finance creditors. Crop security was very low due to\r\n                unpredictable weather conditions.\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                Since farming is seasonal most farmers grow the same variations\r\n                of Vegetables. Surplus crops brought down incomes expected or\r\n                ended up going to waste due to being unable to sell.\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                Farmers want timely information that follows the crop calendar\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                Farmers considered other farmers as competitors. They trust\r\n                middlemen and government bodies more than banks, MNOs’ and\r\n                financial institutes\r\n              </li>\r\n              <li>\r\n                Government information was only available to them during\r\n                weekdays. Which meant leaving all the work behind to go speak to\r\n                an expert for advice (So they rarely went for advice)\r\n              </li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            It was clear that all farmers are not the same. So next we segmented\r\n            farmers into archetypes. This helped us decide who we are designing\r\n            for and who will be early adopters. Within each group, we looked for\r\n            patterns across farmers who have similar attitudes, aspirations,\r\n            community engagement, access to information, financial access, and\r\n            technical literacy.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={magri_frog_table} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <p>\r\n            ‘Optimistic’ and ‘stuck’ farmers were target early adopters for this\r\n            service. Next we mapped the information collected in the field,\r\n            considering each touch point. Then we highlighted the pain points\r\n            and opportunities. We could see that every step of the journey a gap\r\n            existed in getting advice.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Framing all the insights we embarked on brainstorming ideas to solve\r\n            problems in general. The problem was reframed to;{' '}\r\n            <strong>\r\n              “How might we provide timely information to farmers?”.{' '}\r\n            </strong>{' '}\r\n            Common patterns emerging through the 80 farmers made it clear that\r\n            the information gap neede. The information had to come from the\r\n            source they trust; the Government. So we were collaborating with\r\n            various government bodies from then on.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={magri_frog_wireframe} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <p>\r\n            Next the team went back to the insight board from the research and\r\n            iterated a key product feature for each insight. Out of a pool of\r\n            value propositions we identified that the product should bring the\r\n            right information to a farmer on request. It had to be giving\r\n            instructions in their native language.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Then we created a service blueprint. Later we decided on a feasible\r\n            product to launch quickly and planned for it. The minimum viable\r\n            product was for basic feature phones. Based on service blueprint we\r\n            listed the features. Quick pen and paper sketches iterated ways to\r\n            get the basic user interface in shape. We were back on the field\r\n            with card sorting to see if farmers appreciated the value added by\r\n            us to the product.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={magri_frog_prototype} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <p>\r\n            We looked at other key findings from our field work. 89% Farmers had\r\n            access to one very budget feature phone but also had secondary\r\n            access to a smart phone within their family. Hence we embarked on\r\n            rapid prototyping a basic low fidelity mock up of the product and\r\n            visited the farmers to test how they respond to it. Even though\r\n            farmers are highly intelligent people a simple ‘dial 1 for carrot, 2\r\n            for leek, and 3 for gherkin ‘created a lot of confusion in them. So\r\n            we were back on our insight board re-iterating a simple system that\r\n            is easy to understand by our core user. Farmers had only used a\r\n            mobile phone to make calls. So we started training agents to help\r\n            them learn how to respond to a voice message.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            One of the ideas I generated at these brainstorming was to print a\r\n            physical calendar. This will hang on the wall of a farmer that\r\n            helped him document and keep account of the dates through a set of\r\n            stickers which seemed easy and practical. Yet it was just another\r\n            post-it under idea generation until we pull it up refined and merged\r\n            it with an insight from the field. Farmers were a part of a “give me\r\n            a missed call” culture which made them respond to most calls while\r\n            on the field. This resulted in a printed calendar with the service\r\n            and provided reminders of all the ‘missed call’ numbers Dialog\r\n            offered. This ‘missed call’ feature was simple and so we went back\r\n            to our farmers positive of the outcome.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img\r\n            className=\"image main\"\r\n            src={magri_frog_inaswithcalander}\r\n            alt=\"\"\r\n          />\r\n          <p>\r\n            Farmers had to give a missed call to 6166 when they started\r\n            preparing their land. The next missed call to 6167 will denote that\r\n            they had now moved to the next stage in the farming cycle, seeding,\r\n            and so on. Results showed that this was way too complicated. The\r\n            many numbers were hard to remember. The messages on the calendar\r\n            were not fully understood. Farmers clearly indicated their desire\r\n            for timely crop information and always expected a person to be on\r\n            the other end of the line.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            This resulted in developing the final product to contain advice\r\n            through both automated outbound dialling (OBD) and interactive voice\r\n            response (IVR). The trained agents of the service went door to door\r\n            and taught the farmer how to get the service. The solution was a\r\n            simple automated voice service that sent farmers information on best\r\n            practices, seasonal advice and general guidance. A farmer has to\r\n            dial 616 and follow instructions. One number was easy to remember\r\n            and it also helped promote the service to another farmer by world of\r\n            mouth. The service charges one rupee per day and was easy to\r\n            understand.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Further feedback from call centers and our basic research insights\r\n            helped us design the final UI and cater to not only the rural farmer\r\n            but the home grow enthusiast back in Colombo.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img className=\"image main\" src={magri_frog_interfaceofapp} alt=\"\" />\r\n          <h3 className=\"major\">Reflection</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            35% of the target audience registered. 87% registered users’\r\n            accessed content. 86% of content accessing users became repeat\r\n            users. 75% of active users paid for the service. (According to\r\n            independent study by GSMA in 2016). Paddy (rice) and home gardening\r\n            are the most popular topics. Young farmers preferred the smart phone\r\n            app. Research to add daily weather alerts and market price update\r\n            features are on the way. Team felt within the time frame this area\r\n            has room for improvement. Majority still get the service on their\r\n            feature phone to this date. Feature phone or smartphone the service\r\n            had value getting the information hard to possess for a farmer. Back\r\n            in urban areas where information was easy to access users felt the\r\n            service was very basic.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <section className=\"features\">\r\n            <article>\r\n              <a\r\n                href=\"https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/govi-mithuru-mobile-agriculture-service-dialog-sri-lanka.pdf\"\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n                className=\"image\"\r\n              >\r\n                <img src={magri_frog_casestudyimage} alt=\"\" />\r\n              </a>\r\n              <a\r\n                href=\"https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/govi-mithuru-mobile-agriculture-service-dialog-sri-lanka.pdf\"\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n                className=\"special\"\r\n              >\r\n                See the case study\r\n              </a>\r\n            </article>\r\n            <article>\r\n              <a\r\n                href=\"https://www.dialog.lk/govi-mithuru/\"\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n                className=\"image\"\r\n              >\r\n                <img src={magri_frog_articleimage} alt=\"\" />\r\n              </a>\r\n              <a\r\n                href=\"https://www.dialog.lk/govi-mithuru/\"\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n                className=\"special\"\r\n              >\r\n                Read article\r\n              </a>\r\n            </article>\r\n          </section>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </section>\r\n  </Layout>\r\n);\r\n\r\nexport default IndexPage;\r\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_govi_frog_interfaceofapp-920b365a88218f4a78a7a23cfde95993.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_govi_frog_lilian_and_me-2572543afcba7a3fdde855af8610a696.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_govi_casestudy_img-1e9f7e524a70d527d7803d5898c8b59a.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_snacker_user_persona-7d3c9729b29eaa2805419aeacd0b548f.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_govi_frog_postitwall-7d9a3f3ac6a8eb32d09fa4c75a746e54.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_govi_frog_inaswithcalander-7ea7181cf5c159e82b70c57765fbcb3f.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/project_image_govi_1-e28c49addcf3cc6db9ca70ae0b7e4b46.png\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
