They are always in the look for adventure. This is when the question arose; Can‘t the weather protection designed give the adventure fact while protecting from rain? Can there be a device to give the basic shade needed without the complicated structures? Can I get inspiration from history to solve this problem?

My solution takes roughly 15 minutes to be manufactured in that same facility. The beauty of this design is that it suites the user perfectly with the instant cover and the masculine semiotics in the product and simultaneously serves the clients objective of catering to the local need utilizing the available resources of the company.
